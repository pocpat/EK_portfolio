Our conversation began with your request for a code review of your portfolio project, focusing on code quality, performance, security, and error handling. You then provided a prioritized list of issues you wanted to address, including centralizing project data, modularizing CSS, enhancing frontend error handling, securing backend credentials and CORS, implementing server-side input validation, and refactoring the contact form. You specifically requested that the ProgressBar animation not be simplified.

I have since confirmed the successful implementation of all these prioritized changes, ensuring the ProgressBar animation remains intact. Your project is now more maintainable, secure, and robust, making it ready for professional deployment.
